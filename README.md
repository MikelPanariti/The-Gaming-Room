# The-Gaming-Room

The Gaming Room had a Android app game called "Draw It or Lose It", and wanted to develop a web-based game to run on multiple platforms. The game will have multiple teams with several members assigned to each team. The game will have 4 rounds that last 1 minute each. The application will render images at a steady rate and will be fully completed after 30 seconds. The team should guess the puzzle before the time ends, or the other teams will have the chance to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle within 15 seconds.	Game and team names must be unique to allow user to check if a name is in use.Only one instance of the game can exist at any given time.

I analyzed the technical requirements for the game and made recommendations related to the Operating System, Storage and Memory Management and the games security features. When making these recommendations I kept in mind the security features needed for the game, but also user's experience and making sure that the game allows for a seemingly experience throughout different platforms. 

Having an UML diagram of the game allowed for a better understanding of the relationship between classes and the methods and attributes required in these classes. I think that I could have offered more details when making recommendations about the Operating Systems and its Architecture allowing for a better understanding of why Windows was the reccomended OS and what Windows API is and how it imporves the functioning of the game. When it comes to user experience, I made sure to outline that the game needed to be optimized for speed and offer an user friendly design that offers an seemingly design between different platforms. User Experience is the most important feature to keep in mind after security as the Users are those who will be the main source of revenue for the company developing the game.

When developing the Software I started by creating a template of the requirements and work towards reaching those objectives. As I worked to fulfill these requirements I made sure that data security, user experience and the game's functionality were the main focuses.
